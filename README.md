Pair Programming fun with Jesse Thach and Tiffine Koch

We created a JSON file - this took most of the time because we had to sort out the data
We create our object and properties
We created a game object template
We created a handlebar template
We used SMACCS principles
We wrote a function to $.get our json file, load our game, and append to our handlebar template

If we had more time, there are lots of opportunities to improve this
project with things we have learned in our 2 weeks:
- use jquery methods to show/hide images
  on click event listeners
- create a SQL database to help sort this massive data (crap)load and render our game more efficiently
